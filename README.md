# 10fastfingers-mod
Chrome plugin to change the https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/ website. 

For now, all this plugin does is remove the timer from the website. I dislike the timer being there, and though you can hide it by clicking on it, it comes back when refreshing the page. Since I don't like to use the mouse and just want to keep using the keyboard when using this website, I don't like having to click it over and over again.

Maybe in the future this plugin will have more options and more small changes, but for now this will suffice.
